A video is worth a thousand pictures: http://vimeo.com/easytarget/vidcheroo1

The project is currently in stable alpha mode.

Vidcheroo does not come with sample videos. If you need files for the media feed, feel free to contact me.

Vidcheroo is basically a music video generator; a video switching program that uses musical tempo and beat measurements to randomly go through media files. It is intended to be a tool for VJs to create visuals that accompany dance music.
During tests, I was able to synchronise to a 1/16th beat at about 130bpm and 1/8th at 190bpm. Anything quicker was difficult to visually test. 1/8th at 120bpm should be possible on most modern setups.
